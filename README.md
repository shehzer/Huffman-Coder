# Huffman-Coder

Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code, commonly used for lossless data compression.

Used primarily for compressing and decompressing large files, the Huffman-coder generates a variable-length code table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence (weight) for each possible value. 

The compression was done through the implementation of Huffman Trees, Ordered/Unordered ArrayLists, and Binary Tree ADTs
